## Teacher Accounts

Teacher credentials are stored in `teachers.json`.

Default credentials:

- `ms.smith` / `teach123`
- `mr.johnson` / `teach456`

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.
